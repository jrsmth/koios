## The Quadratic Formula
- The Quadratic Formula gives us a method to solve quadratic equations:
  - When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
    $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
- Derivations:
  1. Completing The Square:
     - Dividing by $a$ (allowed because $a \ne 0$) and subtracting $\frac{c}{a}$, gives us $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = \frac{-c}{a}$
     - The *LHS* is now ready for solving by Completing The Square:
       - We add $k^2$ in the form of $\frac{b}{2a}$ to create a squared binomial of the form $x^2 + 2kx + k^2$
       - Thus, $x^2 + 2(\frac{b}{2a})x + (\frac{b}{2a})^2 = \frac{-c}{a} + (\frac{b}{2a})^2$
         - Contracting the squared binomial gives $(x + \frac{b}{2a})^2 = {(b^2 - 4ac) \over 4a^2}$
         - Taking the square root and subtracting $b \over 2a$ gives the Quadratic Formula:
           - $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
- For given coefficients, the solutions correspond to the roots of the graphed equation

## Completing The Square
- Like the Quadratic Formula, Completing The Square gives us a method of solving quadratic equations
