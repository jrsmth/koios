## The Quadratic Formula
- The Quadratic Formula gives us a method to solve quadratic equations
  - Markdown mathematics... worth time investment...
  - When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
    $$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
- Derivations...
- For given coefficients, the solutions correspond to the roots of the graphed equation
  - More on this...

## Completing The Square
- Like the Quadratic Formula, Completing The Square gives us a method of solving quadratic equations
