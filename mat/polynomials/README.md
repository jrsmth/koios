## The Quadratic Formula
- The Quadratic Formula gives us a method to solve quadratic equations:
  - When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
    $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
- Derivations:
  1. Completing The Square:
     - Divide by `a` (allowed because $a \ne 0$)
     - Subtract $c \over a$, giving us $x^2 + b \over a x = -c \over a$
     - The LHS is now ready for solving by Completing The Square:
       - We add $k^2$ in the form of $b/2a$ to create a squared binomial of the form $x^2 + 2kx + k^2$
       - Thus, $x^2 + 2(b \over 2a)x + (b \over 2a)^2 = -c \over a + (b \over 2a)^2$
         - Contracting the squared binomial gives $(x + b \over 2a)^2 = (b^2 - 4ac) \over 4a^2$
         - Taking the square root and subtracting $b \over 2a$ gives the Quadratic Formula:
           - $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
- For given coefficients, the solutions correspond to the roots of the graphed equation

## Completing The Square
- Like the Quadratic Formula, Completing The Square gives us a method of solving quadratic equations
